# Reactive Docking

## Description
In vanilla X4: Foundations subordinates assigned to a carrier with the 'Launched' option will remain docked until something relevant to their group's order happens. 
For example if the leader is attacked then groups with 'defend' will launch to defend.
Though for non-carrier capital ship subordinates in 'Launched' mode will instead remain launched constantly whether they are needed or not.

This mod provides an additional docking option to non-carrier capital ships with landing pads. This new docking option is called 'Reactive' and makes subordinates behave like they are carrier-based.
To provide this extra option the Docking/Launched button found in loadout info submenu and 'Enter' menu has been changed to a dropdown for non-carriers.

Carriers will not have this option and their 'Launched' mode remains unchanged.

## Requirements

* SirNuke's Mod Support API [[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042901274) | [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/503)]
* (OPTIONAL) Kuertee's's UI Extension and HUD version >= 2.0.6 [[Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/552?tab=description)]

## Compatibility
This mod is save compatible. You can add it to an existing save, and remove it without errors. If removed then groups with the 'Reactive' option enabled will simply change to 'Launched'.

This mod achieves compatibility with other UI mods through the UI Extension and HUD mod.
To work with Subsystem Targeting Orders at least version 3.3 and of STO, and 1.1 of this mod is required.

## FAQ

1. *My fighters does not do anything when I set the new docking option.*
	- Try issuing the fighters a "Fly And Wait" command. Then just remove it again. This should force the fighters to use the new docking option.
	
2. *When I have ships in storage, and one on the pad, and all are to launch why does the ship currently on the pad not launch first, rather than stow only to launch after another has?*
	- As far as I can tell this is vanilla behavior for the game. So I dunno what I could do about it. The game doesn't seem to make any priority for ships already on a pad if both it and one in storage needs to launch.

3. *When they return to dock on my leader with one pad, only 1 ship docks and the rest just cancel their docking?*
	- Again, seems to be vanilla behavior. They get cancelled because the pad is occupied. Why they don't just queue up to dock I don't know atm.

4. *I wanna fix your shitty code*
	- You are very welcome to make requests to the [github](https://github.com/runekn/x4-reactive-docking).

5. *When I change the pilot or take manual control of a ship the Reactive mode is removed?*
	- Yes, the only way I know to transfer changes from UI to the escort script is to use the pilot's blackboard. So the reactive mode is attached to the pilot.

6. *My Reactive option is disabled?*
	ï»¿- This should only happen if the leader ship has no pilot. If the ship has gotten a pilot and the option is still unavailable, try just closing and reopening the menu. If that still does not work, submit a bug report please.
